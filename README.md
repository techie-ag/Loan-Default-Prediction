# Loan-Default-Prediction ðŸ™ˆ
Using Machine Learning to predict the default of loan using a loan data set obtainable from Kaggle.

The aim is to analyse the data set and carry out a predictive modelling on the data to check whether there will be a loan default or not.
Classification model building was used as the target variable has a yes/no value.
Random forest classifier, Decision tree classifier and Logistic regressions were the machine learning algorithms used.
Various model evaluation was carried out on the model algorithms to obtaini and choose the best performing models.
